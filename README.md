This demo project for Transformer's Battle. The Application follows all the Rules and Regulation for the Battle. 

#### Features of The App :
This Application for Transformer's Battle between Autobot and Decepticon team.

Each Transformer has the following criteria (ranked from 1 to 10).
- Strength
- Intelligence
- Speed
- Endurance
- Rank
- Courage
- Firepower
- Skill

#### Basic rules for Battle :
1. The teams should be sorted by rank and faced off one on one against each other in order to
determine a victor, the loser is eliminated
    - A battle between opponents uses the following rules:
    - If any fighter is down 4 or more points of courage and 3 or more points of strength compared to their opponent, the opponent automatically wins the face-off regardless of overall rating (opponent has ran away)
    - Otherwise, if one of the fighters is 3 or more points of skill above their opponent, they win the fight regardless of overall rating
    - The winner is the Transformer with the highest overall rating
2. In the event of a tie, both Transformers are considered destroyed
3. Any Transformers who don’t have a fight are skipped (i.e. if it’s a team of 2 vs. a team of 1,
there’s only going to be one battle)
4. The team who eliminated the largest number of the opposing team is the winner

#### Special rules for Battle :
1. Any Transformer named Optimus Prime or Predaking wins his fight automatically regardless of any other criteria
2. In the event either of the above face each other (or a duplicate of each other), the game immediately ends with all competitors destroyed
